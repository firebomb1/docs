# Yieldies

## Summary
A Yieldy is an ERC20 rebasing token that is redeemable 1:1 with the underlying ERC20 asset.  The system 
allows a user to stake the underlying asset in order to mint a yieldy version of the asset.  The underlying asset
is then deployed into the DeFi ecosystem to generate yields that are redistributed to stakers in the form of rebases 
to a user's balance of the Yieldy asset. Users get access to simplified yield that can easily be transferred
to another user without having ever to worry about un-staking and can watch rewards accrue to their wallet 
each week without having to perform any actions.

## Background
In March 2022 the Shapeshift DAO launched FOXy, a rebasing version of FOX that allow FOX holders to stake
their FOX and earn yield as their balance of FOXy increased in their wallets weekly.  The underlying FOX collateral 
was deposited into Tokemak to provide additional liquidity and TOKE rewards. These TOKE rewards were then transferred to 
the Shapeshift DAO treasury and converted to FOX that powered the rebases in FOXy. From this design, Yieldies were born to 
generalize the same mechanism across any ERC20 asset.
