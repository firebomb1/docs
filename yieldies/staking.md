# Staking

> NOTE: Un-staking may require a user to wait 7-14 days, please read more about un-staking before you mint your first Yieldies

Minting Yieldies can be done through the [ShapeShift app](http://app.shapeshift.com/) and involves 
two on-chain transactions.  The first transaction is to grant the Staking contract approval to transfer
the underlying ERC20 token on your behalf, and the second transaction will mint your yieldies 1:1 with 
the amount of underlying asset selected. 

Yieldies can also be bought on the secondary market, which at times may be cheaper than minting so its worth checking there first.
Currently, [ElasticSwap](https://elasticswap.org/) is the only AMM supporting these tokens.
