# ðŸ’° Bounties

The DAO values and understands that talent is widespread, and having the flexibility to choose one's determined task can create the ability to establish trust and value within a global community. Offering the ability to tap into this globalized talent pool through an organic and growing bounty process presents opportunity and capability for resources to be utilized within the needs of both the community and the contributors willing to share determined ability to build together.

The DAO has different workstreams that can and frequently offer bounty work when available. We are continuing to build our resources and working on common documentation that will further detail work expectations as well as effective process flow.
