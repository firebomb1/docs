# ðŸŒ‰ LI.FI

LI.FI has built a middle layer between DeFi infrastructure and the dApp layer. It is the ultimate gateway to any swapping and bridging available today. LI.FI Bridge & DEX Aggregation Protocol gives you access to all Bridges and DEXs, both on- and cross-chain.

**One SDK to get you multi-chain**&#x20;

LI.FI offers on-chain swaps, cross-chain swaps and a combination of both. It aggregates all the bridges, DEXs and DEX aggregators so you don't have to.

So far ShapeShift has been able to implement LI.FI bridging between EVM Chains. Bridging between various other chains is expected to come in the future, so stay tuned!
